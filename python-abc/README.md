# python-abc

## Description
Exercises focused on Abstract Base Classes (ABC) and interface design in Python.

## Projects
- `task_00_abc.py`: Create and use an abstract base class.
- `task_01_duck_typing.py`: Practice duck typing and flexible interfaces.
- `task_02_verboselist.py`: Extend list behavior via inheritance.
- `task_03_countediterator.py`: Build an iterator with counting behavior.
- `task_04_flyingfish.py`: Compose behaviors with multiple inheritance.
- `task_05_dragon.py`: Model complex objects with ABC constraints.

## Why It Matters
These projects build confidence with abstraction, interface contracts, and polymorphism.
